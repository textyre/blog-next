  *Hi, my name is Uliyan, as you are guess. And it's my first words on my personal blog.
  I will be writing some posts and my minds here. Tell us about yourself:
  I am frontend-developer since for 2017. Actually I wanted to become a developer
  since for my childhood. I have education community colleges (in Russia its as middle technical degree)
  of programming in computer systems. At college's time I recognize that I love and I want to
  develop user interfaces. It doesn't matter how and what a tools I use, but matter what the interfaces I do.
  Web technology gives me more power to create interfaces rather then other technologies.
  Because of that I chosen be the frontend developer. And as I grow I am want to sharing my
  researches and knowledge. So, that blog being starting point.*

  *Best Regards, \
  Uliyan Mudrakov, \
  Frontend developer*
